		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This collection furnishes data on executions performed under
civil authority in the United States between 1608 and 2002. The dataset
describes each individual executed and the circumstances surrounding
the crime for which the person was convicted. Variables include age,
race, name, sex, and occupation of the offender, place, jurisdiction,
date, and method of execution, and the crime for which the offender was
executed. Also recorded are data on whether the only evidence for the
execution was official records indicating that an individual
(executioner or slave owner) was compensated for an execution.</span></p>

Case number 40001 was dropped, as government records show that she was pardoned. For case number 50367, the method of execution was changed from hanging to electrocution., 2005-11-04  On 2005-03-14 new files were added to one
or  more datasets.  These files included additional setup files as well
as one or more of the following: SAS  program, SAS transport, SPSS portable,
and Stata system files. The  metadata record was revised  2005-11-04 to
reflect these additions., 2004-02-27 Data from the years 1992 through 2002 have been
added to the data file. The SPSS and SAS data definition statements
have been updated accordingly and Part 2 of this study, old SAS
data definition statements will be removed, leaving all files in only
one part. The ASCII codebook has also been updated and converted to a
PDF file., <p>1988-01-06 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Performed consistency checks.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
